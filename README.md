### Due to so many variants of COVID-19 and its increasingly efficient methods of contagion, UEFA has decided that for the next UEFA Champions League tournaments, the group stage and round of 16 draws will not allow any kind of contact ( not even visual) in a closed space as used to be done previously, so the possibility of hiring some developers who comply with the following prototype is sought.

### We want (the UEFA) a UML diagram and then a program in python that will use OOP as a paradigm based on the diagram created before. The program must carry out the group stage draws and the knockout round of 16.

### For the knockout round of 16 you must comply with the original rules of the draw:

### According to the regulations, the draw cannot match two teams that have met in the same bracket in the group stage or two teams from the same championship or league (if this second is not possible, please match randomly).
